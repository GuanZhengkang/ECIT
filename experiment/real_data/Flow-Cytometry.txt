Note: This dataset is an **interventional** dataset.

We selected data under two interventions: **cd3cd28** and **cd3cd28icam2**, because these interventions are exogenous and do not affect the causal graph structure or the conditional independence (CI) relationships.

Both files are provided in the `./Data Files/` directory.

We refer to the variable relationship diagram in **Figure 2** of [1], which reflects biological consensus and is treated as expert knowledge (ground truth).
Based on this, we selected:
- 50 conditionally **independent** (CI) pairs
- 50 conditionally **dependent** (NI) pairs

(Note: In [2], the conditioning sets for NI cases are generally large. We modified and extended some of them to better represent a broader range of scenarios.)

The pairs are saved in `CI.txt` and `NI.txt`, respectively.

Our experimental results can be found in:
- `Flow-Cytometry.ipynb`
- `Flow-Cytometry_ccit.ipynb` (run separately due to high computational cost of CCIT)
